We decided we should eat at P.F. Chang's. In my car on the way, she was telling me about the last time she went to eat here she had a unique drink. Her last boyfriend and her got silly off of this stuff and had a great time. It was called Sake. Apparently the warmer version of Sake is, \"better for the body\" and so I'm all for it! When we sat down outside, very quickly and it was 8pm, the table was dirty but cleaned and cleared off in a timely manner. So we get to ordering and have us some Sake. We do our cheers, I say \"I love this non-pressure situation because were such good friends, so, to a date with a friend!\" we both take the shot....and this is what I say. \"Michelle, is there supposed to be ice in the warm water?\" I stick out my tongue and there was a glass shard about half of the size of a dime. We look inside the little Sake drink and sure enough, a few more pieces of glass in the bottom of the container. I could of been so impacted by the glass if swallowed but my instincts told me it wasn't right to have that object on my tongue. I mean really a piece glass was in my mouth, sharp too, wasn't expecting that kind thing to happen. Anyway, besides almost freakishly choking on glass they gave us 3 more Sake orders for free and the food was fantastic as always. The ordeal was handled great by our waitress. If she didn't act the way she did, I definitely would have sued. But I'm didn't freak out like my friend would have she told me. If I was bleeding then it would have been different because you don't know where that glass came from. We both thought it would be a great story, I can say that's true.   -Sake glass survivor"}], "max_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0}}

Our waiter arrived quickly and took our beverage orders, then departed. He was back soon with our beverages as well as some delicious and maybe artery-hardening rolls. The restaurant was filling up, so he was delayed a bit in taking our meal orders, but he took them quickly and competently, ensuring that we each knew what our ordered steaks should look like on the inside. He then departed. Those of us who ordered house salads received them quickly. Then we waited - and waited - for our steaks. But, when our main courses arrived, everything was piping hot, and the steaks were all exactly as we had ordered them. EXACTLY! Additionally, although I don't eat much red meat, my steak was very tender and very, very tasty. Reasonably priced, also. It would be hard to convince me that I could have found a better steak, comparably priced, than the one I enjoyed at this Texas Roadhouse. The only reason I marked them down a notch was the time it took to get our meals to us, but maybe I just don't understand.

The Bloody Mary comes with so much garnish it's like getting a free appetizer, and it also comes with a side of beer (about 2 oz, I think).   Our server, Erica, was gracious, friendly and knowledgeable. Even with her mask on, we could tell that she smiled constantly while serving us.

They have trained their staff well to please the customer (my wife was a former server) and the steak was cooked exactly as we asked it.  I like medium.  My wife liked medium-well, and it was served as the epitome of those definitions.  The portions were large with a variety of sides and add-on options to choose from.  We were not disappointed in any way and came away with leftovers for the next day.  Rochester needed a true steakhouse.  This is it. On the point of cost:  The prices are on par with other restaurants in the area, including The Outback, Hubble House etc.  I feel that the steak was prepared in a better way, better cuts, no gristle \u2013 a real good steak for a steak price.  The consumer gets what he pays for here.  The bill could grow large if a whole family were brought, but if one watches what he drinks and looks at the menu, there isn\u2019t a better made steak for the money in town.  By the way, the servers do a line-step dance about once every hour.  Cute, and adds to the atmosphere.    If you bring kids, prepare to pay.  I'm not sure my picky-eating son (8) would have liked much and my daughter (10) would have appreciated the meal for the price."}], "max_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0}}

We used to look forward to a trip to Benihanas, but now, each yearly visit reminds us why we don't go there much anymore.  If I do go, I will no longer order scallops or lobster as you take your chances on whether the cook will be able to cook them properly.  After paying so much for a lobster tail, it's very disappointing to find it inedible. Mine was burnt and so overdone that I literally couldn't eat it. It was like rubber. My scallops were barely edible. They were black on the outside and slightly underdone in the middle.  If you are going to order seafood, stick with shrimp as they never seem to ruin that.   When another diner at my table asked that their steak be cooked a bit more as it was not what they ordered, the chef argued with them about it, claiming it was cooked medium as they ordered it.  The diner felt that it was too rare.  Regardless of the chef's opinion, he should have just listened to the diner and put it back on the grill.  Our chef also missed the shrimp on one diner's order and had to ask for more to be brought.  Service by the servers is also usually poor. The bathrooms were dirty with toilet paper on the floor.   When I called to make a reservation, the person on the phone was snarky.  \"Well, we only make reservations over an hour in advance, but we have room today so I'll do it for you this time.\"   While this may be their reservation policy, they could have communicated it politely. Imagine a very snarky voice who was doing me a big favor by taking my reservation.   It's a shame this location is so poorly run as Benihanas has been a favorite place of ours for a long time, but Short Hills is the worst location I've seen."}], "max_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0}}

Also ordered a vodka martini which was small and very weak.  However, the service was very good. Our server did a good job.  But  I don't know how this place stays in business with high prices and small portions.  I will not be returning anytime soon."}], "max_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0}}

Our reservation was at 7:30 but we arrived around 7:00 to grab a drink at the bar. I went to the hostess stand at 7:30 to see if our table was ready and I was told they would come and get us in two minutes. I continued to be told that for the next 20 minutes. I finally told the hostess that I wanted a real estimate because we'd been told two minutes for a while. She apologized and we ended up being seated a few minutes later. To make up for our wait, they gave us complimentary appetizers which were excellent. I would have much rather been told up front that our table wasn't ready the first time. Other than the wait, the food and service were excellent. I usually always get dessert but since we were sat 20 minutes late and had a car service coming later I didn't have time. It was a little pricy but very good food. I would recommend it but be prepared to wait."}], "max_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0}}
