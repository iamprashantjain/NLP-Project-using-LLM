       "'As a Marriott Loyalist, this property should not be considered a 5-star resorts per Marriott standards.  It is a property that has not yet found its identity.  I would rate it 3.5 stars with a 5-star designation for the bungalows and the availability of the Diamond club services. It is a small property, not as large as what one would think of when using the word resort.  Although the landscaping, is well maintained, the rooms, pool areas, cabanas, need routine maintenance, if addressed in a timely manner, these would not be major issues.   Rooms do have a slight musty smell, and one guest on our floor did complain about a sewage smell, but I believed they were able to clean out their shower drain and it took care of the problem.   Perhaps having repair cards available in rooms where guest can alert the property to minor repairs before they become major, could assist them.  The Food in the specialty restaurants was ok and although I had no problem eating in the buffet, it was basically the same options served every day.   In my opinion, the people of Antigua  are proud of their Island and want to make all visitors experiences a positive one.   Many of the complaints may stem from the designation of a 5-star Resort “Casino” and Spa, which has caused a higher level of expectation and entitlement than the “Marriott” Royalton Antiqua can deliver.  A little work, a little rebranding, and a managerial/executive initiative to truly listen and actually act on some of the reviews in lieu of the standard thank-you canned responses could help in escalating this property to the level of achievement it is trying and deserve to be at. Check-in- Process –Unless we arrived on an off day, this process needs to be improved.  As Diamond club, you are escorted to an area up front to wait for a scooter to take you to the Diamond Club lounge.  Once at the Diamond Club Lounge, you again wait again for check-in.   Process took well over an hour.  Assigned Butlers Matara and Paul were excellent meeting all needs and promptly filling all requests. Every staff member, I encountered always had a positive greeting and smile. Having had a career in the service industry, I am more critical than others, but had no criticism what so other involving the staff.  Guests, however, in some cases were another story.  There are ways to express displeasure with out condescending, disrespect, and talking down to the staff. (Diamond Swim-out). The rooms had a slight musty smell, but I could find no evidence of mold.  They were a good size, and the beds were comfortable.    The swim outs were great, some of the tiles needed to be replaced, however that is a routine maintenance negative aesthetic observation. *If you book a Swim out room preference should be on the 10 side.  There is a little more privacy.   We also visited our friends who upgraded to a bungalow.  The online pictures do not do the bungalow justice!  Diamond Club Amenities include the Butler service, a lounge which has snacks throughout the day and top shelf liquor.  By booking a Diamond room you receive a fruit plate and champagne on arrival, plus each room is entitled to your choice of a top shelf litre of liquor. Diamond club also offers a    private section of beach, private pool and jacuzzi, separate pool side bar and grill, and Cabanas (for rent) on Diamond side which is quieter than the Cabanas located in the main pool area. There is a small stretch beach which is clean, and tranquil with beautiful calm blue/turquoise water.  The pool on the Diamond side was clean and quiet. Plenty of seating and staff service for drinks and/ or food.   The non- Diamond side pool was full of fun and activities with the Vibe team engaging the guest to enjoy their vacation to the fullest There is enough entertainment to keep you busy- Theme nights, White Party, etc. Although stated on some websites there is no Casino on site and has not been for some time'"

       "'As a Marriott Loyalist, this property should not be considered a 5-star resorts per Marriott standards.  It is a property that has not yet found its identity.  I would rate it 3.5 stars with a 5-star designation for the bungalows and the availability of the Diamond club services. It is a small property, not as large as what one would think of when using the word resort.  Although the landscaping, is well maintained, the rooms, pool areas, cabanas, need routine maintenance, if addressed in a timely manner, these would not be major issues.   Rooms do have a slight musty smell, and one guest on our floor did complain about a sewage smell, but I believed they were able to clean out their shower drain and it took care of the problem.   Perhaps having repair cards available in rooms where guest can alert the property to minor repairs before they become major, could assist them.  The Food in the specialty restaurants was ok and although I had no problem eating in the buffet, it was basically the same options served every day.   In my opinion, the people of Antigua  are proud of their Island and want to make all visitors experiences a positive one.   Many of the complaints may stem from the designation of a 5-star Resort “Casino” and Spa, which has caused a higher level of expectation and entitlement than the “Marriott” Royalton Antiqua can deliver.  A little work, a little rebranding, and a managerial/executive initiative to truly listen and actually act on some of the reviews in lieu of the standard thank-you canned responses could help in escalating this property to the level of achievement it is trying and deserve to be at. Check-in- Process –Unless we arrived on an off day, this process needs to be improved.  As Diamond club, you are escorted to an area up front to wait for a scooter to take you to the Diamond Club lounge.  Once at the Diamond Club Lounge, you again wait again for check-in.   Process took well over an hour.  Assigned Butlers Matara and Paul were excellent meeting all needs and promptly filling all requests. Every staff member, I encountered always had a positive greeting and smile. Having had a career in the service industry, I am more critical than others, but had no criticism what so other involving the staff.  Guests, however, in some cases were another story.  There are ways to express displeasure with out condescending, disrespect, and talking down to the staff. (Diamond Swim-out). The rooms had a slight musty smell, but I could find no evidence of mold.  They were a good size, and the beds were comfortable.    The swim outs were great, some of the tiles needed to be replaced, however that is a routine maintenance negative aesthetic observation. *If you book a Swim out room preference should be on the 10 side.  There is a little more privacy.   We also visited our friends who upgraded to a bungalow.  The online pictures do not do the bungalow justice!  Diamond Club Amenities include the Butler service, a lounge which has snacks throughout the day and top shelf liquor.  By booking a Diamond room you receive a fruit plate and champagne on arrival, plus each room is entitled to your choice of a top shelf litre of liquor. Diamond club also offers a    private section of beach, private pool and jacuzzi, separate pool side bar and grill, and Cabanas (for rent) on Diamond side which is quieter than the Cabanas located in the main pool area. There is a small stretch beach which is clean, and tranquil with beautiful calm blue/turquoise water.  The pool on the Diamond side was clean and quiet. Plenty of seating and staff service for drinks and/ or food.   The non- Diamond side pool was full of fun and activities with the Vibe team engaging the guest to enjoy their vacation to the fullest There is enough entertainment to keep you busy- Theme nights, White Party, etc. Although stated on some websites there is no Casino on site and has not been for some time'"
